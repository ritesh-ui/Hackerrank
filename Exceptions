'''Exceptions
Errors detected during execution are called exceptions.

Examples:

ZeroDivisionError
This error is raised when the second argument of a division or modulo operation is zero.

>>> a = '1'
>>> b = '0'
>>> print int(a) / int(b)
>>> ZeroDivisionError: integer division or modulo by zero
ValueError
This error is raised when a built-in operation or function receives an argument that has the right type but an inappropriate value.

>>> a = '1'
>>> b = '#'
>>> print int(a) / int(b)
>>> ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '#'

Handling Exceptions
The statements try and except can be used to handle selected exceptions. A try statement may have more than one except clause to specify handlers for different exceptions.

#Code
try:
    print 1/0
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    print "Error Code:",e
Output

Error Code: integer division or modulo by zero

Task

You are given two values  and .
Perform integer division and print .

Input Format

The first line contains , the number of test cases.
The next  lines each contain the space separated values of  and .

Constraints

Output Format

Note:
For integer division in Python 3 use //.'''

a=int(input())

for i in range(a): 
    try:
        b,c=input().split()
        b=int(b)
        c=int(c)  
        print(b//c)
    except ZeroDivisionError as e:
        print("Error Code:",e)
        continue
    except ValueError as v:
        print("Error Code:",v)
        continue
